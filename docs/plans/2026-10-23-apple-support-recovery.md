# Apple capability recovery across settings windows

This pass addresses confirmed recovery defects adjacent to installed-only
translation initialization. It does not establish the cause of the user's
reported update behavior or authorize model downloads and native foreground tests.

## Capability cache and publication

A failed Apple Speech or Translation inventory query currently becomes a cached
empty success. Later settings snapshots therefore skip loading it again. Keep
the published state empty on failure, but distinguish a failed query from a
successful unsupported/empty result. The next settings read may retry a failure.
Speech resource revisions continue to describe changes in published content;
equivalent failures cannot advance that revision and trigger a refresh loop.
A partial preparation confirmation must not certify a complete inventory scan.

Coalesce concurrent bootstrap reads, including failures from the same attempt,
under the existing refresh ownership boundary. A later caller may retry a
completed failure. Serialize explicit Translation refreshes so an older error
cannot overwrite a newer success. No polling, persistent ready marker or
dependency is needed.

When a settings read changes effective capabilities, publish the exact returned
snapshot to existing windows. An equivalent read does not need a broadcast.
Concurrent readers may emit equivalent recovery snapshots; consumers already
compare resource signatures, so these finite duplicates must not start a loop.

## Visible query ownership

Apple Speech must treat reopening a hidden page as a fresh visit, even if its
language signature is unchanged. Old readiness cannot remain actionable while
that visit's query is pending. A signature refresh within the same visible visit
must instead keep its current controls mounted and disabled, so an in-flight
recognition check can finish when another locale's inventory changes.
Apple Translation support and pair-status retries
must become busy immediately and share an in-flight request for the same context.
Hide, profile/pair changes and explicit preparation invalidate older results.
Hidden views do not initiate retries. Keep current localized progress/error copy.

## Verification

First reproduce the failed-cache, cross-window publication and stale/busy UI
boundaries with controlled results. Cover failures followed by recovery,
unsupported success, partial preparation, concurrent bootstrap reads, explicit
refresh ordering, duplicate Retry, old promises after navigation, and preservation
of a current recognition check during an unrelated locale refresh. Use the
real helpers and components with injected native results; no real model is needed.

Run the canonical suite and actual Android JVM JNI coverage because shared Rust
changes are involved. Review affected Apple settings through hidden browser
fixtures at minimum/default widths and representative locales. Keep screenshots
outside Git. These checks do not replace signed same-identity restart/update,
native preparation or real translation acceptance, which remain deferred while
the user watches video.
